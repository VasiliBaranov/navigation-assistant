This page contains possible improvements for the Navigation Assistant


= Details =

Improvements may include:
  # Implement support for "Save as" and "Open" windows
  # Implement support for FAR Manager
  # Implement extended support for hotkeys (not only Ctrl, Alt, Shift, A-Z; but also F1-F12, ScLok, PrtSc, Break, etc)
  # Add numbers to the matches list, allow choosing them by Ctrl+<match number>
  # Support installation without administrative rights (for corporate environments)
  # Support slashes in the paths (e.g. by "prog fi\vis stud" find "C:\Program Files\Visual Studio")
  # Add support for removable drives
  # Add support for non-local folders (e.g. if a user adds in the "Folders to parse" setting line "\\other_machine\Videos")
  # Improve memory consumption (force garbage collection, optimize cache storage-don't store full cache and filtered cache, store just filtered cache and full cache changes; when serializing cache on dispose serialize just changes; on deserializing normalize the cache file and combine current changes)
  # Improve file system parsing (use preexisting NTFS or Windows indexes, as done in [http://www.voidtools.com/ Everything]
  # Implement Exclude Folders option (in contrast to Include Folders and Exclude Templates) (e.g. exclude just C:\Windows and parse all other folders)
